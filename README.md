# Gatsby + Prismic

Build best-in-class static websites using [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.com/) and
[Prismic](https://prismic.io/).

This repository is a monorepo managed using Yarn workspaces. This means there
are [multiple packages](./packages) managed in this codebase, even though we
publish them to NPM as separate packages.

  plugin for building websites using prismic.io as a data source.
